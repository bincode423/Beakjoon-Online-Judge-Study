# üìö Baekjoon Online Judge Study

Hello! This repository is my personal study space where I collect and document solutions to various algorithm problems from **Baekjoon Online Judge**. It reflects my journey of improving algorithmic problem-solving skills and maintaining consistent coding practice.

## ‚ú® Purpose of the Repository

This repository aims to:

* **Record the problem-solving process**: Document my thought process, approach, and final solutions for each problem.
* **Master algorithms and data structures**: Apply different algorithm types (search, sorting, dynamic programming, etc.) and data structures (arrays, graphs, etc.) to real problems to deepen my understanding.
* **Maintain learning motivation**: Solve problems consistently and track my growth over time.
* **Review and improve code**: Revisit old solutions to find more efficient approaches or potential improvements.

## üöÄ Programming Language

All solutions in this repository are written in **Python**. I use Python‚Äôs simplicity and powerful libraries to tackle algorithm problems effectively.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on algorithm and data structure types, making it easy to find solutions for specific topics. Each folder contains solutions to Baekjoon problems related to that topic.

* **1D Array**

  * Covers problems ranging from simple array manipulations to more efficient 1D array usage. Includes basic iteration, insertion, deletion, and related concepts.

* **Graph**

  * Includes implementations of graph traversal algorithms such as BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search).

* **Loops**

  * Covers basic looping structures using `for` and `while`, nested loops, and examples of efficient loop usage.

* **Input/Output and Arithmetic Operations**

  * Practices the fundamentals of reading input, printing output, and performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* **Recursion and Dynamic Programming**

  * Covers **recursion** concepts and applications, as well as **dynamic programming** techniques ranging from basic to advanced.

* **Conditionals**

  * Uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to execute different code paths depending on given conditions.

## üí° How Can You Use This Repository?

* **Learn a specific algorithm**: If you want to study a particular algorithm type (e.g., Graph), browse the relevant folder.
* **Get problem-solving ideas**: If you‚Äôre stuck on a Baekjoon problem, check similar problems here to get inspiration.
* **Compare code**: There are often multiple ways to solve a problem. Comparing my solutions with others can help you find more optimal approaches.

I hope this repository serves as a small but helpful resource for your Baekjoon Online Judge learning journey. Feel free to reach out with questions or feedback anytime!
